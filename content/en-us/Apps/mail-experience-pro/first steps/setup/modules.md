### Setup

### Setting up the individual modules
The Connector 365 Mail Experience Pro app combines the 3 apps from our Mail Pro series into one power app. Below we will tell you how to set up each area. 


##### Mail Subject Plus area
The Mail Subject Plus area is for adding your own dynamic subject lines per report or customer to your emails. You can use placeholders to define your own content.
