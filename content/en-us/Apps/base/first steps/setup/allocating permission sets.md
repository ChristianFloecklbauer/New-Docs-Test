### Setup

### Permission Sets
You can assign 3 different types of permission sets to users. Each grants the user a different level of access to the app:

- **CON365, Setup** - Enables the user to make changes to the Connector 365 Setup.
- **CON365, Edit** - Enables the user to further setup the app. For example managing email attachments, email subjects and similar.
- **CON365, View** - ENables the user to simply use the app.
