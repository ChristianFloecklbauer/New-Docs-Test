# Communication Matrix

Connector NAV's communication matrix was the central setup location to define certain sending parameters, such as destination addresses, for customers and vendors.
In the Connector 365 product line, document layouts from the Microsoft standard are used for the same purposes.

The **Connector 365 Base** app displays the document layouts under the name **Communication Matrix** on the list pages and card pages of the customers and vendors:

On this subpage, settings can be set up analogous to the document layouts.
Further fields of the document layouts, which have been added by other **Connector 365 apps**, are also displayed in the communication matrix.

The communication matrix, as well as its fields, can be shown or hidden at any time via personalization.
