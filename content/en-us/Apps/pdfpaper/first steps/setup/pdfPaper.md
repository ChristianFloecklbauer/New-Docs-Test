### Setup

### Connector 365 PdfPaper

In order to use the Connector 365 PdfPaper app, a connection to the iPaper software must be established. This is done via the **"Connector 365 Setup"**, which you can find via the search function.

There you will find 3 fields for setup:

**PdfPaperIn** - Here you have to specify the input folder from the iPaper setup.
**PdfPaperOut** - Here you have to specify the output folder from the iPaper setup.
**Maximum Wait Time** - Specifies how long to wait for the iPaper to be processed, values less than 30 seconds are automatically counted as 30 seconds.

This completes the setup and you can deposit your stationery. How this works can be found in the [next step](/en-us/apps/pdfpaper/first-steps/setup/reportselection).
