### Working with the PdfPaper App

### Using the stationery
Once stored, the stationery is automatically remembered when PDFs are created. In doing so, we support any operation where a PDF is provided.

We support the following reports

| **Sales**          | **Purchase**          |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Quote             | Inquiries             |
| Sales Order             | Purchase Order         |
| Blanket purchase order       | Blanket sales order   |
| Post. sales invoice    | Sales purchase invoice   |
| Post. sales credit memo | Post. purchase credit memo |
| Reg. Reminder       |                      |

Our other apps that involve PDF creation also support the Connector 365 PdfPaper app:

- Connector 365 E-POST API
- Connector 365 XRechnung
- Connector 365 Easy Batch

#### Preview function
Before actually creating the PDF for the process, you have the option to preview it once. Select your document and then use the preview function via **Print/Send** -> **Preview**. The finished document will now be displayed.
