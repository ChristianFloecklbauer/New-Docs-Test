### Working with CTI for STARFACE

### Click to dial
With our app you have the possibility to start calls directly from your contacts. Open the contact you want to make a call with and open the area **"Communication"**. Next to the phone number there is now a button with 3 dots. Click on the button to initiate a phone call.

 _If no call is triggered, you may have to switch off the popup blocker of your browser or set your STARFACE client to open phone numbers._
