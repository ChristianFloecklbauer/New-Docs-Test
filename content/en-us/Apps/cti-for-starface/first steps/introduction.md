### First steps

### Introduction

Controlling the telephone activities of your employees can be time-consuming. A constant switching between the STARFACE client and the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central environment causes a break in the workflow. But this break can be prevented.

**Full control over your STARFACE CTI**

With our Connector 365 CTI for STARFACE it is possible to turn your Dynamics 365 Business Central environment into your CTI center. We offer you many options that help you to fully utilize your STARFACE solution. Our features help you to get a quick overview of your call time, so that minute-based services can be recorded in your invoice. We can also help you to relieve your sales staff by automatically opening the contact card of callers.
