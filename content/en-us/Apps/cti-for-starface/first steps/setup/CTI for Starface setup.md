### CTI for STARFACE in the Connector 365 setup

To set up the Connector 365 CTI for STARFACE app, first use the Business Central search function and open the **Connector 365 setup**. There you will find the **CTI for STARFACE setup** section.

Global settings for the functionality of the app can be made here.
 The **Open CTI page** field can be used to select whether the CTI window is opened for calls and for which call direction this should apply: incoming, outgoing or both directions.
The **Time the CTI page is opened** field defines whether the window is opened when the call is set up (ringing) or only when the call partners are actually connected.
Under **No. not found action** you can specify what should happen when an unknown number calls. The options are that no action is triggered, that the creation of a contact is queried or that a new contact is created directly. Further information on this can be found in the [Incoming calls] section (en/apps/cti-for-starface/working-with-cti-for-starface/incoming-calls/).

In addition to these global settings, settings can also be made for [Users and groups](en/apps/cti-for-starface/first-steps/setup/user-groups/).
