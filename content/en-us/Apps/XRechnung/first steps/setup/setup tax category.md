### Setup

### Check the Tax Category

It is also worth looking at the tax category, which can be found in the **VAT Posting Setup**. This again can be called up most quickly via the search function.

Here you should now fill the field “Tax category” with the respective designation, you can find this [here](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/codelist/UNCL5305/) finden. In most cases you will only need E S and Z.
