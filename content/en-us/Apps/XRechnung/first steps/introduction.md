### First steps

### Introduction

#### XRechnung - the standard for electronic invoicing for public clients
As of **27.11.2020**, suppliers of public clients must send invoices in the so-called **"XRechnung" format**. This format is an XML-based data model that is currently being established as the standard for electronic invoices.

According to the [Decision of the IT Planning Council of 22.06.2017](https://www.it-planungsrat.de/SharedDocs/Sitzungen/DE/2017/Sitzung_23.html?pos=3) (Link only available in German), XRechnung is decisive for the implementation of the [Directive 2014/55/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055) (Link only available in German) in Germany. XRechnung thus forms a reliable basis for the exchange of electronic invoices from and with German administrations.

The XRechnung standard is operated by KoSIT on behalf of the IT Planning Council and consists of various components that support technical implementation. The standard was developed by experts from the federal, state and local governments as part of the eRechnung steering project.
