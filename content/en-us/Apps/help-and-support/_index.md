### Statement of Direction und Support-Lifecycle

BELWARE GmbH is continuously working on the further development of Connector NAV to ensure that the product can always be used for the same ERP solution or version for which Microsoft Dynamics NAV provides support. This includes ensuring that Connector NAV is always compatible with the current version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV. For customers with a maintenance contract, the new versions and hotfixes are provided free of charge and are included in support. Excluded are services such as merging objects or individual adjustments. Due to regular updates of Connector NAV, support for older Connector NAV may be discontinued. This will be announced in advance. If you are affected by this, you are welcome to inform yourself about further steps via info@belware.de.
