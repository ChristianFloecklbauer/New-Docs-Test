### SMTP2FAX in E-Mail Outbox

If a fax was saved as a draft via the [dialog](en-us/apps/smtp2fax/working-with-smtp2fax/smtp2faxdialog/) or if the transmission failed, it is entered accordingly in the Business Central e-mail outbox, recognizable here by the Fax label in the Job mode field.

There the message can be deleted or resent. 

If, on the other hand, the message has been sent successfully, it is entered in the list of [sent e-mails](en-us/apps/smtp2fax/working-with-smtp2fax/sentemails/).
