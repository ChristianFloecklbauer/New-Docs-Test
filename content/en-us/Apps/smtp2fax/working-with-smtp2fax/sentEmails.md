### SMTP2FAX in Sent E-Mails
If a fax was sent successfully, there is a corresponding entry in the list of sent e-mails, which is included in Business Central by default. The entry can be recognized by the marking as fax in the Job mode field.

If necessary, the message can be deleted or resent at this point.
