### SMTP2FAX in Connector 365 Setup 

To get to SMTP2FAX setup, first use the Business Central search function and open the Connector 365 Setup. There you will find the section SMTP2FAX Setup.

Clicking on the entry opens the tab with the input fields required for the setup.

Here you only need to specify the domain of your fax server, which handles the delivery of the e-mails to the fax recipients concerned.  The address to which a fax is sent is automatically composed of the recipient's fax number, the @ sign and the specified domain. 
Another place where settings for the use of SMTP2FAX can be made are the [document layouts](en-us/apps/smtp2fax/first-steps/setup/doclayout/) of debtors and creditors.
