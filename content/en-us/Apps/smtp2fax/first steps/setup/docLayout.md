### SMTP2FAX in the document layouts 

For specifying the recipient's fax number, there's an according field available in the Business Central Standard on the card page of the creditor or debtor. However, the SMTP2FAX app also adds another field to the document layouts table, where you can specify the fax number for different use cases.
