### Test & Purchase

### OnPrem
It is not necessary to purchase the app, as it is only suitable for existing customers who used a system up to BC14, already used Connector NAV/BC on it and then switched to a newer system with Connector 365 apps.
For this customer group, the use of the app is included in the maintenance costs.
A test phase is therefore also unnecessary, especially as the app is ideally only used once.

If required, the app will be made available to you as a runtime package suitable for your system.

You can then start with the [installation](en-us/apps/connector-upgrade/first-steps/installation/onprem/) of the Connector 365 Upgrade App.
