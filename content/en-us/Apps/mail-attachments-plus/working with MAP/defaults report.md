### Working with Mail Attachments Plus
After you have added the attachments you want in the report selection, you can start sending the mail. If you have not done so yet, you can find the setup of the [Report Default Attachments](/en-us/apps/mail-attachments-plus/first-steps/setup/defaults-report/) in the **"First Steps"** section.

For this example, we have set up the default attachments in invoice as follows:

In this example, we have attached two PDFs and a time-limited image for the language code DEU.

 _If you are using a Business Central version in which the Mail Experience is not yet available, the procedure is a little different._

#### Mail with standard attachments per report

To do this, simply open the report for which you previously set up your attachments and then click **"Print/Send"** and the regular **"Send by Email"** function.

The standard Microsoft Mail Experience will open, if you scroll down to the Attachments section you will find the attachments you previously set up.

You will certainly have noticed that not all attachments that were previously set up were also attached, this is because one of the attachments was provided with a certain period in which we are currently not.

If one of the attachments does not fit, you can simply remove it as usual, via the 3 dots and **"Delete"**.

Using the Mail Attachments Plus App does not prevent you from using the attachment functionality of the standard. You can still add more attachments via the menu bar under **"Attach file"**. With a click on **"Manage"** and then **"Attach file"** this is also possible.

When you have made all the changes to your attachments, you can send your mail as usual by clicking **"Send email"**.
