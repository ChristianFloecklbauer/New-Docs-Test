### Working with Easy Batch

### Batch Function

After all the customers have been set up according to your wishes, you can start sending.

To do this, open one of the desired reports, e.g. your pos. sales invoices.

Now select the documents that you want to send

You are completely free in the selection - if desired, you also have the option to send individual documents as a batch.

As soon as you have selected the vouchers for sending, you can start the batch. You will find the function for this under **Print/Send** -> **Send by batch**.

No further dialog opens, processing is based on the previously set job modes and is performed at the time you specified in the **Easy Batch Setup**.

Each process will be enqueued as a single task under [Connector 365 Open Tasks](/en-us/apps/easy-batch/working-with-easy-batch/open-tasks/).
