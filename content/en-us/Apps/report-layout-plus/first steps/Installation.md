The Microsoft AppSource will open. There you can use the search function again to find the **Connector 365 Report Layout Plus**. Click on **Free Trial** to start the installation. Before the installation starts, you have to provide some contact information.

You will not be notified about the completion of the installation, but the process should not take more than a few minutes.

If everything worked, you can now find **Connector 365 Report Layout Plus** under **Installed Extensions**.

You can now start with [setup](en-us/apps/report-layout-plus/first-steps/setup/allocating-license/).
