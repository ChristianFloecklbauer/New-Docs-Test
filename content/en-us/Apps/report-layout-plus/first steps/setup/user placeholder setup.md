### User Placeholder Setup

To set up the user placeholders, first navigate to the **User setup** page.
There you can access the setup via the **User placeholder setup** action.

In the user placeholder setup, you can set up dynamic placeholders using table fields.
Fields from the following tables are currently supported:
- User setup
- User

In the **Placeholder** field, you define the character string which is replaced in the email text by the values of the field stored in the **Definition** field.
For the placeholder replacement to work, you must integrate it into your report layouts for e-mail texts.

The settings made on this page apply equally to all users.

There you can select the desired field to assign it to the placeholder.
