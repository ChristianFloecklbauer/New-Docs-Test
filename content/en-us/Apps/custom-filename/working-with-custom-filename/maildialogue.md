# Send by e-mail

### File name in mail dialog
After setting up for file names, you are now ready to actively use your previously defined file name(s).

### Using your own file names for e-mail attachments


First open one of the documents you have set up and then open the desired document (if applicable, that of a customer/vendor you have set up). Now click on **"Print/Send "** -> **"Send by e-mail "**. The dialog for sending by mail will open.
At this point, navigate to the attachments. The document to be sent should correspond to the new file name.
