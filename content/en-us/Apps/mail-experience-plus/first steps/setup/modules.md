### Setup

### Setting up the individual modules
The Connector 365 Mail Experience Plus app combines the 3 apps from our Mail Plus series into one power app. Below we will tell you how to set up each area. 


##### Mail Subject Plus area
The Mail Subject Plus area is for adding your own dynamic subject lines per report or customer to your emails. You can use placeholders to define your own content.

##### Mail Attachments Plus area
Mail Attachments Plus allows you to control your mail attachments at various levels and specify attachments that will always be attached to specific reports when sent by default. Control for attachments over a period of time is also possible.

##### Addressee Control
Addressee Control allows you to control of the addressee per report type.
For each report type you decide wether the customer from the field **Bill-to Customer** or **Sell-to Customer** will be used to define the addressee.
