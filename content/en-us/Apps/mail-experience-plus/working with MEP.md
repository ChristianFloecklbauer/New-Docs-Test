### Working with Mail Experience Plus
The Connector 365 Mail Experience Plus app combines the 3 apps from our Mail Plus series into one power app. Below we provide information on how to use each area. 


##### Mail Subject Plus area
The Mail Subject Plus area is there to add your own dynamic subject lines per report or customer to your emails. You can use placeholders to define your own content.

For each report type you decide wether the customer from the field **Bill-to Customer** or **Sell-to Customer** will be used to define the addressee.
