### Working with Mail Sender Plus

### The Dialog

![](images/apps/senderdialog.png)

Once the desired sender addresses have been set up, it is possible to start sending mail.
Open a report and send it per mail.

You will notice a new **"Email Sender"** field once the dialog opens. From there it is possible to access the list that you have just filled and manually selet an address. After selecting the desired sender, confirm with OK to start the process as usual.

If it is desired it is also possible to set a permanent default via report selection or in the document layouts per customer/vendor. The priority system will then set the correct address for you by default.
