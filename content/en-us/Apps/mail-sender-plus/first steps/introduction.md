### First steps

### Introduction

The Connector 365 Mail Sender Plus App allows you to control and use multiple mail sender addresses via an extended mail setup. By default, it is only possible to use a single SMTP sender address per company. The Mail Sender Plus App offers a priority-controlled setup for various scenarios within the sender addresses. It is possible to simply change the address in the dialog or set an address as default per report or customer/vendor. With that it is for example possible to set a global address for the sending of invoices. With our App you can make your mails more personal.

{{<notice warning "Attention">}}It should be noted that Mail Sender Plus can only be used up to version BC17.0 and therefore only onPrem. In later versions of Business Central, the function of the app is already covered by the mail scenarios of the standard.{{</notice>}}
