### Setup

### The Priority System

As mentioned in the introduction, the addresses that will be used are controlled by a priority
system. The priority system works as follows, from lowest zu highest:

1. Default
2. An address per user
3. An address per report
4. An address per customer

This documentation will go into detail how to set up each layer to your wishes.
