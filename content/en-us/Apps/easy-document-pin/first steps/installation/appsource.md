The Microsoft AppSource opens. There you can use the search function again to find the **Connector 365 Easy Document Pin**. Click on **Get it now** to start the installation. Before the installation starts, you have to provide some contact information.

After submitting your contact information, you will be prompted to choose a language for the app. Our Connector 365 E-POST App* is available in English and German. Then click **Install**.

You will receive a short confirmation that the installation is being performed. This takes place fully automatically in the background

You will not be notified about the completion of the installation, but the process should not take more than a few minutes.

If everything worked, you can now find the **Connector 365 Easy Document Pin** under **Installed Extensions**.
