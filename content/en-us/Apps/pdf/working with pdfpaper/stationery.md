### Working with the PDF app

### Use the stationery
Once stored, the stationery is automatically merged when PDFs are created. We support work processes in which a PDF is made available.

The following reports are supported:

| **Sales**               | **Purchase**               |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Quote                   | Inquiries                  |
| Sales Order             | Purchase Order             |
| Blanket Sales Order     | Blanket Purchase Order     |
| Post. Sales Invoice     | Sales Purchase Invoice     |
| Post. Sales Credit Memo | Post. Purchase Credit Memo |
| Reg. Reminder           |                            |

Our other apps that create PDFs also support the Connector 365 PDF app:

- Connector 365 E-POST API
- Connector 365 XRechnung
- Connector 365 Easy Batch

#### Preview-Function
Before actually creating the PDF for the process, you have the option of displaying it once in a preview. To do this, select your document and then use the preview function via **Actions** -> **PDF-Preview**.
Here you can see how the finished document will look like.

#### Use attachment configuration
Once stored, the attachments are automatically added to your document when it is created. The respective attachments are added before or after the main document, depending on the position defined. If you have stored a cover sheet as the first attachment, this is automatically merged with the main document when the report is sent and is then at the top of your PDF file.

#### Use conformance level
If you use one of the specified conformance levels, you can send your reports in different PDF/A-formats.
