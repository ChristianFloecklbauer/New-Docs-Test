### Introduction
With the Connector 365 PDF App, you can apply your high-quality stationery with your CI to your digital documents without the need for time-consuming report adjustments - these are no longer necessary.

The Connector 365 PDF App allows you to store your own stationery for each report and also for each customer. Before sending your documents, you can still check the final result using the preview function.
