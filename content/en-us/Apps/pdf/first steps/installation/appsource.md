### Installation
This section deals with the installation of the Connector 365 PDF. In SaaS environments, you have two options for installing the app: **externally** and **internally** in Business Central. 

Depending on the current Microsoft upgrade policy, you may not have the latest version of the app. To upgrade to the latest version, open the Dynamics 365 Business Central Admin Center and upgrade the app for your environment.

### AppSource
You can purchase the Connector 365 PDF via the AppSource. To do this, search for **PDF** in the Microsoft AppSource and select the relevant app. You may need to refine the search by adding **BELWARE**. 
Now click on **Free Trial**. You will now be redirected to a page where you must log in to Business Central and select the desired environment for installation. Now follow the instructions to complete the installation.

#### Marketplace for Extensions
In addition to purchasing the app via the AppSource, you can also obtain our Connector 365 PDF directly in Business Central via the Marketplace for Extensions. The Marketplace for Extensions is the integration of the AppSource Marketplace in Business Central.
To install the Connector 365 PDF via the Marketplace for Extensions, please carry out the following steps:
1. Enter **Marketplace for Extensions** in the ***Tell me*** functions and open the corresponding link.
2. Search for **PDF**.
3. PDF from BELWARE GmbH will now be displayed in the search field. If the app is not yet listed, add **BELWARE** to your search.
4. Select the app and click on **Free Trial**.
5. Enter the necessary contact information and click on **Next**.
6. Select the desired language: German or English and then click on **Install**.
7. The Connector 365 PDF will be installed. Once the download is complete, you will receive a brief confirmation.

### Overview of your installed extensions
After installation via the Microsoft AppSource or via the Marketplace for Extensions in Business Central, you should find the app in the **Extension Management** under the listed installed extensions. You can also view the status of the respective extension and manage it here.
