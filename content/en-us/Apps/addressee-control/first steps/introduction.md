### Introduction

With the Connector 365 Addressee Control App you can flexibly determine which destination addresses should be used for sending documents. You may want to send a document to the customer by default and not to the invoice recipient as is usual in the standard settings.

Furthermore, you have the option of conveniently adding additional destination addresses per customer or vendor. You can also specify whether a recipient is to be reached via CC or BCC.
