### Working with multiple e-mail recipients

After you have successfully [set up](/en-us/apps/addressee-control/first-steps/setup/multiple_recipients) additional target addresses for a customer, you can simply send your desired voucher, for a customer/vendor that you have set up, by e-mail.
To do this, first go to the desired document page. Example: **Posted Sales Invoices**.
At the top of the action bar, go to **Print/Send**, and then **Send by Email**:

|-|

The e-mail dialog window opens as usual:

|-|

Under **Message Details** you can see the email recipients.
The [set up](/en-us/apps/addressee-control/first-steps/setup/multiple_recipients) additional e-mail addresses have been inserted directly into the corresponding lines.
By clicking on **Send** the e-mail will be sent to all recipients entered, taking into account the set receive options (CC, BCC ...).

If you do not see the lines **CC** and **BCC**, click **Show more** in the upper right corner.
