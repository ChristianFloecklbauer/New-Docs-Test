### Working with E-POST

### Sending

{{< notice info "Note" >}}
The document types [supported by our app](en/de/apps/e-post/first-steps/introduction/) can be found summarized in the [introduction](en/de/apps/e-post/first-steps/introduction/).
{{< /notice>}}

In our example we focus on posted sales invoices. All other documents can be processed the same way.

First select the document you want to send.

Now there are two ways to send the document as a letter. Either by using the standard function **Send...**, whereby the document is sent depending on the specified **document sending profile** or by using the function **Send as Letter**. 

Both functions can be accessed via the menu bar under **Print/Send**.

### The dialog

In the dialog you have the possibility to adjust certain options for sending the letter, e.g. whether you want to send the letter in black and white or in color.

After you have made all desired changes, you can execute the dispatch with a click on **OK**. Your invoice will now be sent to Deutsche Post and from there to the recipient's mailbox.
