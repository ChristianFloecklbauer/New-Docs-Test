### First steps

### Fast hybrid sending with the Connector 365 E-POST App

The need to receive invoices by mail is still ubiquitous. What does this mean for my ERP Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, which can be used from anywhere? Document processing in the traditional sense - printing, inserting, franking and posting at the post office - can delay the process - especially if the document creator is not on-site. Depending on the volume of documents to be sent, this process can become even more time-consuming - time that could be used more productively.

**Per mouse click off into the mailbox**

However, thanks to the Connector 365 E-POST App*, the days of sending invoices manually are over. You can now send your invoices by post from anywhere with just one click. After installing the Connector 365 E-POST App, you have the option to select a document and send it using the following familiar sending options:

Document types:

- Pos. sales invoices
- Pos. sales credit memo
- Issued reminder
- Sales quotes
- Sales orders

Sending options:

- Black/white or color
- Sending abroad
- Registered mail (posting/return receipt)
- Duplex printing

Report adaptation to a specific Deutsche Post template format is not necessary. A cover letter with the correct dimensions is available. Subsequently, the document is transmitted to the Deutsche Post. Here your documents are processed and sent fully automatically, independent of time and in compliance with the GDPR. You can track and view the current shipping status at any time in Dynamics 365 Business Central.



***The Connector 365 E-POST App is powered by the E-POSTBUSINESS API, a service of the Deutsche Post**
