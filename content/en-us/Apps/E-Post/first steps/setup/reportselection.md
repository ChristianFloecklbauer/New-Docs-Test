## Setup
### Report selection
Before sending the first letter, the reports for sending with E-POST must be defined in the report selection. Currently, this option is available in **"Report selection sales"** and **"Report selection reminder"**.

Only reports with a check mark in the **"Use for E-POST"** option are taken into account.

***The Connector 365 E-POST App is powered by the E-POSTBUSINESS API, a service of the Deutsche Post**
