#### Importing the BELWARE RapidStart package 

Before you can use Rapidstart, you must first install the package we provide into your system. This is done with the help of RapidStart Services, which you can find either directly via the search function or Administration -\> Application Setup. There, open the page for configuration packages.

In the overview for the RapidStart Services you now have the possibility to import the package into your system via "Import Package".

In the dialog that opens afterwards you have to select the package we have provided.

In our package you will find a sample setup for the communication matrix and the additional destination addresses in it, as well as a complete setup of the destination address matrix.
