#### The Dialog

Also in the dialog you have the possibility to adjust the sender address again, provided that the address to be used was previously stored in the Mail Sender Plus setup.

Simply change the address in the "Email sender" field to the address you intended. Afterwards you can confirm the dialog as usual.
