### The documentation for the Mail Sender Plus function

By default, you are only able to use a single SMTP adress per client. The Connector NAV/365 BC Mail Sender Plus feature allows you to use multiple mail senders through an advanced mail setup. The adresses entred in the advanced setup can then be used in the usual Connector NAV/365 BC environment, such as the user reports, to specify the one particular sender.
