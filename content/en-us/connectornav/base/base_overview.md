#### The Connector NAV Files Overview

With the Connector NAV it is now possible to attach external documents to an e-mail in addition to the four attachments. For more details, see the separate documentation for the Email module.

![](/images/connectornav/base/dateien_uebersicht.png)<center>_Connector NAV files overview_</center>

On request, the Connector NAV files can also be added automatically.
Example scenario: A customer has additional PDF documents for certain items. When sending an offer, Connector NAV searches for the corresponding document for the offer lines via an external function and adds these to the e-mail as an attachment.

#### The Connector NAV Feedback Overview

Numerous other fields are displayed or are available in the background. All fields from the confirmation files are read in and are thus available for further processing in Microsoft Dynamics NAV.<br />The most essential information is however the **Statusinformation**, i.e. whether the order could also be successfully executed. The confirmation card offers the possibility the documents from the data base and/or due to the FILELIST data to indicate. It is also possible to import/delete the documents afterwards. A further useful feature is the reactivation from the feedback map.<br /> Advantage of the data base storage is that the data can be indicated always, an access to the path mentioned is not necessary in contrast to the variant without data base storage. In both cases there is quasi an archive of the documents from the job list.
