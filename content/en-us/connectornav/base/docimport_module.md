### The module DocImport

#### Using

With the DocImport module you can centrally manage external documents in Microsoft Dynamics NAV. You minimize your paperwork by storing important documents of any type in the job list. Not only will you find your documents faster, you'll also save time and reduce the likelihood of something getting lost.

#### Moving the documents

Navigate to the path you entered in the **Connector NAV Configuration and Setup** documentation under the **Connector NAV Setup, E-Mail tab** menu item in the **Document Inbox Directory** field. In the example, this is called com_docImport. You can store any documents in this folder.

#### The Connector NAV Incoming Documents

The overview displays all job entries that either have not been assigned to a document or have not been manually set to "assigned". It is the central point for importing the documents. Afterwards, the entries can be assigned directly, or distributed to workgroups. After that the entry disappears in this overview. In the *Connector NAV Workgroup Documents* the list with all entries corresponding to the user's workgroup opens (see documentation Connector NAV Configuration and Setup).
