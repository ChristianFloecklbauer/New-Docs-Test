##### Setting PEPPOL in the Communication Matrix

First go to the communication matrix and fill it as usual for the correct report and the customer who should receive a document in PEPPOL format.

Then in the "PEPPOL Usage" column select the report in which PEPPOL should be used, currently we only support sales invoices and sales credit memos. If you want to turn off PEPPOL for a customer, simply select "No" here.

Then you still have the option to select the version that should be used by PEPPOL.
{{<notice info>}}If you need more information about working with the communication matrix, you can find info in the corresponding [*documentation*](https://belware.de/images/PDFs/Connector_NAV_Matrixdoku_17082020.pdf?type=file).{{</notice>}}
