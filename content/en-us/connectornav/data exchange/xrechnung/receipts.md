##### Possible document types

Currently it is possible to convert the following document types into an XRechnung:

- Sales invoices

- Sales credit memos

- Service invoices

- Service credit memos

The following sections demonstrate an example of XRechnung generation for sales invoices. The procedures shown here for sales invoices are almost identical to those for the other possible document types. That is, you can perform the methods shown here analogously for the other types, such as service credit memos. Only minimal adjustments in the setup of the communication matrix are necessary (**ReportID**, **PEPPOL usage**).
