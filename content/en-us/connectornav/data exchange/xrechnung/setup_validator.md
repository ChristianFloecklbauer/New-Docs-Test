# Set up your own validator

As already mentioned in the XRechnung section of the documentation, BELWARE's XRechnung module uses a service to validate invoices and credit notes in XRechnung format. 
Here, a configurable XML validation tool is used, which was published for the first time by KoSIT (Koordinierungsstelle für IT).
In combination with the appropriate configuration, the validator is able to 
check the syntax, as well as various rules and requirements that are placed on an XRechnung, for its correctness and 
keep a record of the status of the check in the form of a check report.

If desired, the BELWARE XRechnung module can access this validation service via a web service operated by BELWARE. 
If you do not wish to use our service or are unable to use it due to technical restrictions, 
there is the possibility to set up your own validator for validation.

The following explains which steps are necessary to set up your own validator, 
and to address it via the BELWARE XRechnung module from Navision/BC.

## Download the required components

First, the validator itself and the XRechnung configuration must be downloaded.
Both are provided by the provider on Github.

|Product|Link|
|-|-|
| Validator | [https://github.com/itplr-kosit/validator](https://github.com/itplr-kosit/validator) |
| XRechnung configuration | https://github.com/itplr-kosit/validator-configuration-xrechnung |

{{< notice info note >}}
The XML check tool was developed using the Java programming language. 
The installation of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is therefore required in order to be able to execute it yourself.

After extracting the validator (here: ***validationtool-1.5.0-standalone***) you get the following files:
|![](images/apps/xrechnung-validator/validationtool-extracted.png)|
|-|

The file: ***validationtool-1.5.0-standalone.jar*** is the executable file.

The file contents of the XRechnung configuration (here: ***validator-configuration-XRechnung_2.3.1_2023-01-31***) look like this:
|![](images/apps/xrechnung-validator/xrechnung-configuration-extracted.png)|

## Start the validator as a ***Daemon***

If the required files have been downloaded successfully and a Java Runtime Environment is installed, 
the validator can be executed as follows:

Open the Powershell and enter the following command.

``` powershell
java -jar [validator path]/validationtool-[version]-standalone.jar -r [configuration path] -s [configuration path]/scenarios.xml -D -H [host] -P [port]
```
Where the values in the square brackets are to be replaced as follows:
| Value | Explanation | Example |
|-|-|-|
| validator path | The path in which the .JAR file of the validator is present. | validator-1.5.0-distribution |
| version | The version of the ***Validator*** | 1.5.0 |
| configuration path | The path to the ***XRechnung configuration***. | validator-configuration-xrechnung_2.3.1_2023-01-31 |
| host | The address at which the HTTP server "listens". | localhost / 127.0.0.1|
| port | The port via which the HTTP server is addressed | 12345 |

The flag ***-D*** indicates that the service is started in ***Daemon***-mode, i.e. as a service that can be addressed via HTTP.
Upon successful execution, a message should appear stating that the programme was started in ***Daemon***-mode.

{{< notice info >}}
Depending on the version of the validator and the XRechnung configurations, the output at this point may vary.

If the programme is started successfully, it is recommended to set up the functionality as a Windows service.

## Setting up the service in the Connector NAV/BC facility

Now navigate to [***Connector NAV/BC Setup***](en-us/connectornav/configuration-and-setup/setup/setup_connectornav/).
Under the settings ***Pro Mandant***, navigate to the ***PEPPOL/XRechnung Setup***.
Enter the url including the port used in the ***XRechnung Prüfung URL*** field:

{{< notice info Wichtig >}}
The field ***XRechnung prüfen*** must be ticked if a validation of the XRechnungs is to take place.
