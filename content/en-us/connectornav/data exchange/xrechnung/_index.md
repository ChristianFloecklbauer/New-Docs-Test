#### Introduction XRechnung

As of 27.11.2020, suppliers of public clients must send invoices in the so-called **XRechnung** format. This format is an XML-based data model that is currently being established as the standard for electronic invoices.

The **XRechnung** module for Dynamics NAV / 365 Business Central is able to generate such electronic invoices in the **XRechnung** standard.
