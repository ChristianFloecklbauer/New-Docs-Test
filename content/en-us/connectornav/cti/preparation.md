#### Preparation

Before commissioning the CTI module, you should check with the "Performance Monitor" tool whether your telephone system is TAPI-capable. Because this is the basic requirement for the operation of the module.

After you have downloaded and opened the "Performance Observer", you have to select your plant in the tool. This is done at the top left via the "Line" item. Then you can start a test call using the fields at the bottom left. If there is a response from the tool, you can be sure that your plant is usable with our module.
