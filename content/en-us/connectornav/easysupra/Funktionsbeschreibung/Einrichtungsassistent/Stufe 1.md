Create a validity period for the valuation using the "Valid from" and "Valid to" fields. The validity period also takes into account the posting periods of the existing business processes. Define the weighting of the "soft" and "hard" factors using the
factors via "Valuation Hard %" and "Valuation Soft %". Optional are the evaluation requirements, i.e. the specifications for the minimum sales ("Min. purchase (MW)"), the minimum for the purchase order items, the delivery items and the archive items. The optional filters are used for the supplier evaluation as AND links 
and are therefore always used together.
In addition, you have the option of having the supplier re-evaluated after each evaluation-relevant entry by checking the "Evaluation per entry" box. 
relevant posting. This updates the evaluation status on the vendor card. If you do not check this box, a re-evaluation will only be carried out if one of the evaluation reports is executed (see 3.2). Please note the

1. "**Disregard non-answered criteria**": 
All non-answered criteria are not included in the evaluation, so the percentage score allocation redistributes if a criterion is not answered. Example: 
If a creditor's "goodwill behavior" criterion listed in Figure 1 was not maintained, the percentage score allocation of the "transportation connectivity"
and "customer service" increases. The criterion "Goodwill behavior" is not taken into account.

2. "**Value non-answered criteria with 100 points**": 
All non-answered or non-maintained criteria at a supplier will be scored with 
100 points (maximum score). In this case, it is assumed that if a criterion is not answered, the vendor has no deficiencies ("BestCase"). 

3. "**Value non-responsive criteria with 0 points**": 
All criteria that are not maintained on a vendor are scored 0 points
("Worst-Case").

When you have made all the entries, the "Next" button can be pressed. 
This will take you to the criteria selection.
