### Enhancements to standard features:

**Assist button for communication matrix entries in dialog**.
If a recipient's address is overridden via communication matrix, the view pre-filtered via the Assist button is still pre-filtered to the original contact.

**New event for development**
Via the new event OnAfterSetReportIDPostedSalesInv it is now possible for developers to insert a different report ID.

More information about available events can be found in a separate documentation in the future.

### New features:

**E-Post Summary**
With the more expensive E-Post Summary, you can now combine letter mailings from the same recipients and thus reduce the amount of individual letters sent.

More information about this feature can be found in the E-Post [documentation](/en-en/connectornav/epost/)
