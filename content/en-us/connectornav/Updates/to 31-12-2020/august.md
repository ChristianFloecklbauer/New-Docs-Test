[To the documentations](/en-en/connectornav/)

### Enhancements of standard features:

**Automatic filling of the destination address in the communication matrix**.
In the communication matrix, the destination address field is now automatically filled based on the settings in the destination addresses. In addition, there is now an Assist button that is pre-filtered to the respective contact. Of course, a manual filling is also still possible.

**New placeholder for mandates in the additional output**.
In the user report setup, the new placeholder %9 is now available in the path for additional output folders. This placeholder can be used to specify a client-specific folder. This makes it easier to structure multi-client systems. 

### Optimizations:

**Remove error message communication matrix button**.
If the communication matrix was not set up for a contact, an error message used to appear when clicking on the communication matrix button.At the request of many users, we have removed this message and made it possibleAccordion Item 7HeaderIconht to open the communicatrionxmatrix directly.

**E-mail job mode troubleshooting**.
There were several minor programming errors in the E-Post job mode in connection with reminders, these have been corrected
