#### Example process PDF

In addition to PDF creation with the base, you can use the pdfPaper to mix your document with your stationery.

##### Preview function

At any time before creating a PDF file, you have the option to preview your report - a view of your finished PDF. Using this function does not create a job list entry.

There are 2 variants of the preview:

**Pdf Preview -** This preview function works even if you have not licensed the iPaper. There is no mixing with a stationery with this function, only a simple PDF of your report is generated.

**PdfServer Preview -** This function is also a version dependent preview. In this case, a PDF mixed with stationery is generated here if a server variant of iPaper is used.
