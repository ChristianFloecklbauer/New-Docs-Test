#### The Connector NAV User report setup
Using the User Report Setup you can set more individual preferences per user, report and language. A setting in the user report setup has **higher priority** than the Connector NAV user setup (e.g. email sender).

##### Actions
![](/images/connectornav/benreport_einr_aktionen.png)<center>_Connector NAV user report setup, actions_</center>

|Actions describtion| |
|---|---|
|Bodytext/SMS Bodytext<br />Attached file 1 - 4 | These actions can be used to display the intended document.|
|Client/Server stationery<br />Printing process stationery<br />Client/Server | The stationery can be displayed via these actions. (Only visible for the pdfPaper module)|
|Attach files | Standard attachments can be added via this action per job mode, depending on the module.|

After the action is performed, the document opens. There is a message (whether the temp folder should be deleted).

![](/images/connectornav/benreport_einr_aktionen2.png)<center>_Connector NAV user report setup, action Display_</center>

This deletes all downloaded documents located in the local temp directory under %appdata%. Before confirming with Yes, the document must be closed again, otherwise an error message will be displayed. If you don't want this query, you can disable the window in the Connector NAV setup via the function "Clean Temp Folder".

|Additional output folder | In addition to the **Original document** (storage in com_out), a storage folder can be entered here, in which a copy is stored.<br />An example scenario is the transfer of the documents into a DMS system, which are expected at a certain place.<br />Here the placeholder %9 is available, which replaces the mandate in the path. It is important that the folder structure according to the specified path already exists. Since the path is not automatically generated.|
|File name | An individual file name for the original document can be entered here. This entry overwrites the setting "File name is voucher number" from the Connector NAV setup.

|Immediate generation | Here you can set whether the document should be generated immediately (client-side) or in the background. We recommend this setting **for unposted as well as registered** documents or for documents that require **user interaction** (e.g. offers follow-up task).<br />The following documents can be generated in the background by default with Connector NAV:<br />- Sales quotation<br />- Sales order<br />- Geb. Sales credit note<br />- Purchase order<br />- Blanket purchase order<br />- Purchase inquiry<br />- Geb. sales delivery<br />- Reg. reminder<br />- Blanket order<br />- Geb. purchase invoice<br />- Geb. purchase delivery<br />- Geb. purchase credit note<br />- Reg. delivery reminder<br />Further integrations require individual programming without instant generation.|
|With clearance | With this option, the processes are not processed by the background process until a clearance is made via the job list.<br />For example, invoice e-mails can be generated and checked before being sent. More details in the documentation Connector NAV Basis.|
|Dialog on/off | Here you can control for which process the dialog should be visible or not. The **Dialog** checkbox is to be selected generally for all processes. If this checkbox is selected, no individual checks will be performed.|
