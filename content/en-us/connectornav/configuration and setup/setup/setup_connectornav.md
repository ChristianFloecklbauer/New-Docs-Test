#### The Connector NAV setup

##### Actions
![](/images/connectornav/einrichtung_aktionen.png)<center>_Connector NAV setups, actions_</center>

Using the default funktion the fields com_job to com_form are via the server name automatically listed. The funktion DocImport creates for all documents listed in the document entry register an entry in the job list. This way external documents can be made acessable in Microsoft Dynamics NAV.

##### Register general
![](/images/connectornav/einrichtung_register_allgemein2.png)<center>_Connector NAV setup, Register general_</center>

All imporant settings are deposited in the Connector NAV setup once.

|Field describtion |  |
|---|---|
|Server name      | In order to use the Default Settings function, the computer name on which the network share was created is entered here. |
|Source path      | The output file (e.g. PDF) is temporarily created in this path. The variales %USERPROFILE% and %USERNAME% can be used here. These placeholders are replaced by the values of the environment varibles.  |
|Path (com_job)   | The job files are stored in this path. The Connector NAV names and composes the name of the file from the prefix, the sequence number, the job list and the job identifier. <br />Example: CON5236.JOB|
|Path (com_out)   | This path specification serves as destination for the file generated by the printer (e.g. PDF). This is created according to the above scheme. These files are to be deleted or archived from time to time. |
|Path (com_in)    | This is the path specification for incoming faxes.|
|Path (com_ack)   | In this path feedback files are stored, which are read by the Connector NAV. These *.JOB files are later renamed to *.erl files and should be archived from time to time.   |
|Path (com_err)   | In this path feedback files with errors are stored, which are read by the Connector NAV. These *.JOB files are later renamed to *.erl files and should be archived from time to time.   |
|Path (com_tmp)   | This path can be used to store bodypath and attached files. |
|Path (com_form)  | Letter papers (PDF background layout) can be stored here to be attached to a document with the merge programm. Valid when using a product iPaper.   |
|Document File Location | The selection determines where report files created by the Connector are archived. Options are:<br />- void: the files don't get archived<br />- Filesystem: the files get stored in the local filesystem<br />- Database: the files get stored in the NAV database<br />- Database + Filesystem: the files get archived in both the NAV database and the local filesystem |
|Jobmark          | The extension of the job file that your communication software suppoerts is stored here. (OfficeMaster, Twinfax, Faxmaker, Tobit, C3000)|
|FileID           | The fileID for fax transmission is set here. The recommended type is TIFF or PDF.|
|FileID Mail      | The fileID for sending by e-mail is set here. The recommended type is TIFF or PDF.|
|Printer          | This printer driver represents the default printer for the users, so it is NOT necessary to store it again for each user, as long as the same printerdriver (e.g. eDocPrintPro or iPaper) is used. |
###### Information for Windows XP User and the selection of the printer

With the Windows XP operating system, it is possible to assign a default printer to a report, which takes precedence over all other settings. This means that when the report is generated,this printer is always selected, regardless of which printer was selected just before the report was generated. In combination with the Connector NAV, however, collisions may occur if the preset printer in the report is not iPaper or eDocPrintPro. For Example, if you have preset iPaper but use eDocPrintPro in Dynamics NAV an error massage will be displayed.

If you work with such reports, you must either delete the presets or copy the report, remove the preset and assign this new report to the **User Report Setup**.
