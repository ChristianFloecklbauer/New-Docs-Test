We use cookies on our website. These are small text files that are automatically generated by your browser and stored on your device when you visit our website. The cookie is used to store information that is related to the specific device you are using. However, this does not mean that we will immediately know your identity. The use of cookies initially serves to make the use of our services more pleasant for you:

For example, we use so-called session cookies to recognise that you have already visited individual subpages of our website. For example, if you have registered, your password will be stored for the duration of your visit to our website and the change of sub-pages, so that you do not have to re-enter it each time. These session cookies are automatically deleted when you leave our website.

On the other hand, we use cookies to statistically record and evaluate the use of our website and to optimise our services for you. These cookies enable us to automatically recognise that you have already visited our website when you visit it again. These cookies are automatically deleted after a defined period of time. The data processed by cookies are necessary for the purposes mentioned to safeguard our legitimate interests and those of third parties in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f GDPR. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. If you do not wish us to recognize information about your computer, please set your Internet browser so that it deletes cookies from your computer hard disk, blocks all cookies or warns you before a cookie is stored. You can find out how to delete or block cookies in the help and support section of your Internet browser. There you will find instructions on how to search for the file or directory in which cookies are stored. In any case, please note that the complete deactivation of cookies may result in you not being able to use all the functions of our website.

#### 6. Online marketing/analysis tools

The tracking measures we use are carried out on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f GDPR, § 15 Para. 3 TMG. With the tracking measures used, we want to ensure that our website is designed to meet requirements and is continually optimised. On the other hand, we use the tracking measures to statistically record the use of our website and for the purpose of evaluating and optimising our Internet presence. These interests are to be regarded as justified within the meaning of the aforementioned provision.

Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., for the purpose of tailoring our web pages to meet your needs and continually optimising them. (https://www.google.de/intl/de/about/) (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; hereinafter referred to as "Google"). In this context, pseudonymised user profiles are created and cookies (see also section 5) are set. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website, such as browser type/version, operating system used, referrer URL (the previously visited page), host name of the accessing computer (IP address) and the time of the server request are transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. This information is used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services relating to website and Internet use for market research purposes and to tailor the design of these websites to meet customer requirements. Our legitimate interest in data processing also lies in these purposes. The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is § 15 para. 3 TMG in connection with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

This information may also be transferred to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google Analytics' behalf. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with other data held by Google. The IP addresses are anonymised so that an allocation is not possible (so-called IP masking).

The data sent by us and linked to cookies, user IDs (e.g. user ID) or advertising IDs are automatically deleted after 14 months. Data whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month.

Further information on the terms of use and data protection of Google Analytics can be found at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html and http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html respectively.

You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.

You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.

As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile devices, you can also prevent the collection by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie is set to prevent your information from being collected in the future when you visit this website: Disable Google Analytics. The opt-out cookie applies only to this browser and only to our website and is placed on your device. If you delete the cookies in this browser, you must set the opt-out cookie again.

Google Adwords / Conversion Tracking

We also use the online advertising program "Google AdWords" as part of Google AdWords conversion tracking. Google Conversion Tracking is an analysis service provided by Google. When you click on an ad placed by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is placed on your device. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days, do not contain any personal data and are therefore not used for personal identification. If you visit certain pages on our website and the cookie has not expired, Google and we may recognize that you clicked on the ad and were directed to that page. Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. As a result, there is no way that cookies can be tracked from AdWords customer websites. The information collected through the Conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for Conversion Tracking. This tells customers the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were directed to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, you will not receive any information that personally identifies users. These purposes also include our legitimate interest in data processing. The legal basis for the use of Google Adwords/ Conversion Tracking is § 15 para. 3 TMG in conjunction with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can object to this use by preventing the installation of cookies from the domain "googleadservices.com" by setting your browser software accordingly (deactivation option). They will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.
